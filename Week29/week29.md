Week 29 Syllabus Questions

1. You have been given 5000 USD to build your dream computer. The only condition is that you cannot buy a prebuilt computer. Describe what parts you would buy, and explain how they work as a system to create a computer.
 
 With a typical budget, it's important to consider what one needs their computer to do; however, with a budget of $5,000, I'd try and make the best computer possible so it stays current for a long time. This would work well for gaming, or really anything else. 
 
 First, you need a case to hold the contents of the computer. I'd opt for a midsized mATX, because it would not take up too much space by my desk. From there, you also need a power supply which can supply all of the different components. 
 
 You also need a motherboard which is a central location to essentially connect all of the components. This circuit board would have connections to the CPU (AMD Ryzen 9), the GPU (Titan V), memory (I'd opt for flash memory in order to maximize speed), and RAM (I would maximize RAM as well). 
 
 All of these components are high end and expensive because of the high budget, and this enables me to use this desktop for a lot of different uses. The CPU and GPU are both really well suited for gaming (although the GPU is a bit overkill for just gaming -- it would also give me the capabilities to run lots of image classification or graphics heavy actions such as video editing better), and have the potential to be used well for really anything else. Besides that, the memory works in collaboration with these two essential components in order to maximize speed.
 
 Even though the monitor, mouse, speakers (and computer chair!) isn't part of the computer, I would need to have that and connect it accordingly to the computer.
