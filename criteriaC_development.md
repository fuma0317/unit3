Criteria C: Development:
=====================

### Early Development:

There are a few steps which are necessary to begin the development of the user interface for this project. After creating the (design)[https://github.com/rikiod/unit3/blob/master/criteriaB_design.md] on QtDesigner, I began development in order to convert the files to Python files in which all of the buttons and functions work properly. To convert a UI file to a Python file, I used the command `pyuic5 <name of UI file> -o <desired name of Python file>`. 

Once the Python file is created for each individual window, they must all be merged so that you can work on one file.
